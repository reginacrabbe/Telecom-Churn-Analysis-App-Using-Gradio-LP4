## Overview

## Introduction
Welcome to Team Cape Cod's Churn Prediction App! This project utilizes Gradio to create an interactive web-based interface for predicting customer churn using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Objective of Project
The objective of the churn prediction project is to create an interactive application that predicts whether a customer will churn or not based on various input features. The application utilizes a machine learning model that has been trained on historical data to make predictions about the likelihood of a customer leaving a service.

## Significance of Project
The project's significance lies in its potential to positively impact business outcomes by retaining customers, improving profitability, and fostering a data-driven and customer-centric approach to decision-making.

## Project Goals
The goals of this project aim to deliver an effective, user-friendly, and secure churn prediction application that not only serves its predictive purpose but also provides a positive and engaging experience for users.

## Project Approach
The project approach aligns with the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. CRISP-DM is a widely used framework for guiding data mining and machine learning projects. 

## Features

- Predict whether a customer will churn or not based on input features.
- User-friendly interface with radio buttons, dropdowns, and number inputs.
- Styled output indicating the churn prediction result.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/reginacrabbe/Telecom-Churn-Analysis-App-Using-Gradio-LP4.git
    cd your-gradio-project
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Gradio app:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    Open the provided local address in your web browser.

## Usage

- Fill in the input fields with relevant information.
- Click the "Predict" button to see the churn prediction.
- Click the "Clear" button to clear the input options.
- Interpret the output styled with colors (green for no churn, red for churn).

## Example

## Authentication

To access this demo app, use the following credentials:
- Username: `azubiafrica`
- Password: `teamcapecod`

**Note:** This is for demo purposes only. In a production environment, implement more secure authentication methods.

## Styling

The app uses a Gradio theme with a stone color scheme. You can customize the styling based on your preferences.

## Error Handling

The app handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful messages for users in case of unexpected inputs.
